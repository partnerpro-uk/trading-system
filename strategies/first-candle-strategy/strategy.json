      "reasoning": "The first 5-minute candle after market open captures the initial battle between buyers and sellers. Its high and low represent the first consensus range of the day. When price breaks out of this range, it signals which side has taken control. However, rather than chasing the breakout, we wait for price to pull back into a gap left behind by the breakout move, then enter when a strong candle confirms the pullback is over. This gives a better entry price and a tighter stop loss."
